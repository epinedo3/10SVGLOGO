# 10SVGLOGO
## Description

The purpose of this Challenge-10 was to create a SVG Logo-Generator. Using the acceptance criteria that was provided. I had to create an application that generated logos with 3 shapes (square, circle, triangle), and 3 letters. In this challenge we were asked not to deploy our application, but instead use nodemon. Thanks to this challenge I believe to have a better understanding of how to create constructors and export them.
